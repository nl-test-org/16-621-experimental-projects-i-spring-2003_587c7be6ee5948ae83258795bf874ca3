Experimental Projects I, II is the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics' undergraduate project laboratory course sequence. Students take 16.621 one semester, and [16.622](/courses/16-622-experimental-projects-ii-fall-2003/) the following semester. The courses overlap so that 16.621 and 16.622 are taught every semester in parallel. For this reason, the syllabi for 16.621 and 16.622 are contained in the same document.
