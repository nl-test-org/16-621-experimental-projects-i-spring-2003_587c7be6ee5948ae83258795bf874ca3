This lecture schedule describes the 16.621 semester. In 16.621, student teams meet with faculty twice a week as they design their projects. There are more lectures earlier in the semester; later in the semester, students are working independently to complete the design of their experiment. The 16.621 and 16.622 courses run in parallel, so 16.621 students have access to 16.622 oral presentations and to their final project display. In 16.622, students have class only twice during the semester although they attend team meetings with the faculty and weekly meetings with their advisor.

EMM = Prof. Earll Murman  
EMG = Prof. Edward M. Greitzer  
JD = Prof. John Deyst  
JLC = Jennifer Lynn Craig  
TA = Teaching Assistant  
LS = Laboratory Staff
